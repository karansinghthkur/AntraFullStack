1.Describe the problem generics address.
3problems:
maintains type safety:
prevents boxing/unboxing improving performance
code reusability 
2.How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> str=new List<string>();

3.How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
2 type one is key type and one is value type
Dictionary<TKey, TValue>

4.True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
False 

5.What method is used to add items to a List object?
List.Add(T item)

6.Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
List.Remove(T item)
List.RemoveAt(int index)

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
public class Sample<T> where T : Class
{

}
8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter
False

9.True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True

 10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to
True
